#### Why did I develop the software?

I developed the software when I was a high school studentüè´. 
Every time I saw my teacher need to choose a student to answer her question, she will take out a table which contains all students' names in my class and select a student from itüìÉ. 
I thought it was so inconvenientü§î, and I decide to make software to solve the problem, so I developed the software named Randroca.

## Built With

The software mainly uses  WPF of the .NET Framework to build because it is so convenient to beautify on Windows system, and it can save the development time.

## Getting Started

`MainWindow.xaml` is the main interface;
`Float.xaml` is the hover ball;
`About.xaml` is the about-page

### Prerequisites

If you wanna change the user list, you need to modify the function called `Roll_call()` in `MainWindow.xaml.cs`. Inside the function, you will see a string array called `name`, insert some user names that you want to appear on the software's selection. At the same time, you need to add some photos to `resource/face`. They need PNG format, and their file name are the same as the user that you insert into the `name` array.

### Installation

`git clone https://github.com/JonyanDunh/Randroca.git`
`cd Randroca`
